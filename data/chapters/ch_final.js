                <p>TJ's End-of-Course (EOC) exams often test <strong>System Interaction</strong>. For example, solving a system where one equation is a quadratic and another is a logarithmic curve.</p>

            <h3>1. The Synthesis Problem</h3>
            <p>Solve for $x$: $2^{x+1} = x^2 + 4$.</p>
            <p><strong>Elite Strategy:</strong> This cannot be solved purely with logs or purely with algebra. You must use <strong>Numerical Estimation</strong> or <strong>Graphical Analysis</strong> to find the intersections. This is where 'Mental Calc' meets hardware logic.</p>

            <p>In advanced Algebra 2, we move past pure sine waves to weighted waves: $y = e^{-t} \\sin(t)$.</p>
            <p><strong>The Real World:</strong> This models a shock absorber on a car. The $e^{-t}$ is the "Damping Factor" that kills the vibration over time. Understanding how parameters affect the decay is key to engineering.</p>

            <p>How many ways can you distribute 10 identical candies to 3 children such that each gets at least one?</p>
            <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Place 10 'stars' and 2 'bars' between them. $\\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \\binom{9}{2} = 36$.</p>
