# The First Rule: Axioms
## The Atoms of Mathematical Reality


            <p>In the beginning of any mathematical system, we must agree on certain truths. These are <strong>Axioms</strong> (or Postulates).</p>

                <h4><i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> Neo-Sense Analysis</h4>
                <p>Think of axioms as the "Source Code" of the universe. You cannot derive them from anything simpler; they are the bedrock upon which all logic is built.</p>

            <h3>1. The Euclidean Example</h3>
            <p>Euclid’s first postulate: "A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points." It sounds simple, but without it, Geometry cannot exist.</p>

                <h4>🤔 Socratic Inquiry</h4>
                <p>If we changed a single axiom — for example, saying parallel lines <em>must</em> eventually meet — would the resulting math be "wrong," or simply a different kind of reality?</p>
