                    <p>The derivative is the "frozen motion" of a curve. It tells you exactly how fast a function is changing at one exact microsecond.</p>

                <p>The derivative is the "Slope of the Tangent Line". It is the limiting value of secant slopes as the interval shrinks to zero.</p>

                    <p>On the AP exam, if you see a limit that looks like the formula above, <strong>do not evaluate the limit algebraically</strong>. Recognize it as a derivative and use power rules!</p>
