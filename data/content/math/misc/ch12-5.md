                <h2>I. The Central Limit Theorem</h2>
                <p>The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that if you take enough samples, the distribution of their means will be normal, regardless of the population's shape. This is why Statistics works!</p>

                    <h4>Sampling Bias Guardrail</h4>
                    <p>A sample is only valid if it mimics the population's diversity. **Selection Bias** occurs when your methodology systematically excludes certain groups, leading to "Skewed Data".</p>

                <p>If an AI is trained on biased data (e.g., facial recognition trained only on certain ethnicities), the resulting model will inherit those biases. In data science, <strong>Garbage In, Garbage Out</strong> is the law of the land.</p>
