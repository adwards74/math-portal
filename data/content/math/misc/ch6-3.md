                <p>Synthetic division is an optimized version of Long Division. By eliminating the variables and focusing only on coefficients, we reduce the problem to a series of <strong>Multiply-and-Add</strong> operations.</p>

                    <p>In CPU design, synthetic division (Horner's Method) is preferred because it avoids expensive power calculations ($x^n$). It uses a "stream" of data: take coefficient, multiply by $c$, add next coefficient, repeat. It's a perfect example of an iterative algorithm.</p>
