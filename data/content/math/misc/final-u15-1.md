                <p>TJ's End-of-Course (EOC) exams often test <strong>System Interaction</strong>. For example, solving a system where one equation is a quadratic and another is a logarithmic curve.</p>

            <h3>1. The Synthesis Problem</h3>
            <p>Solve for $x$: $2^{x+1} = x^2 + 4$.</p>
            <p><strong>Elite Strategy:</strong> This cannot be solved purely with logs or purely with algebra. You must use <strong>Numerical Estimation</strong> or <strong>Graphical Analysis</strong> to find the intersections. This is where 'Mental Calc' meets hardware logic.</p>
