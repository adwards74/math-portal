                <p>Cosine tracks the horizontal displacement on the unit circle. It is identical to Sine but "leads" by 90 degrees ($\pi/2$).</p>

                    <p>$\cos(x) = \sin(x + \pi/2)$</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">In electronics, this shift is known as being **"Out of Phase"**. If two waves are perfectly out of phase, they cancel each other out (the math behind Noise Cancelling Headphones!).</p>
