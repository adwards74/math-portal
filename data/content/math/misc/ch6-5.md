                    <p>Complex roots always come in pairs?봪ike matter and anti-matter. If $2 + 3i$ exists, $2 - 3i$ must also exist to ensure the polynomial's 'Real' structure remains stable. This is the **Law of Symmetry** in Algebra.</p>

                <h2>I. Symmetry of the Solution Space</h2>
                <p>If a polynomial has real coefficients, the <strong>Complex Conjugate Root Theorem</strong> states that if $a + bi$ is a root, $a - bi$ must also be a root.</p>

                    <p>This symmetry arises because complex roots represent "missing" intersections with the real X-axis. They exist in pairs to maintain the real-valued nature of the coefficients.</p>
