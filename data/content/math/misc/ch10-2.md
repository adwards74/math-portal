                    <p>Completing the Square is not just a trick; it's **Reconstructing the Center**. By forcing the equation into a perfect square, you reveal the 'Gravity Center' ($h, k$) of the shape. It is the algebraic equivalent of 'centering the camera'.</p>

                <h2>I. Standard Form vs. General Form</h2>
                <p>A circle is rarely given in its clean $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ form. Usually, you encounter the **General Form**: $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$.</p>

                    <h4>The Conversion Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>To find the center and radius, we must <strong>Complete the Square</strong> twice?봮nce for $x$ and once for $y$. This is the same logic used in Chapter 5, but scaled for 2D space.</p>
