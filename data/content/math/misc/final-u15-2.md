            <h3>1. Modeling the Damped Harmonic Oscillator</h3>
            <p>In advanced Algebra 2, we move past pure sine waves to weighted waves: $y = e^{-t} \sin(t)$.</p>
            <p><strong>The Real World:</strong> This models a shock absorber on a car. The $e^{-t}$ is the "Damping Factor" that kills the vibration over time. Understanding how parameters affect the decay is key to engineering.</p>
