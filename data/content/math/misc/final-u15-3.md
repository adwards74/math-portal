            <h3>1. Stars and Bars (Combinatorics)</h3>
            <p>How many ways can you distribute 10 identical candies to 3 children such that each gets at least one?</p>
            <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Place 10 'stars' and 2 'bars' between them. $\dbinom{n-1}{k-1} = \dbinom{9}{2} = 36$.</p>

                <p>Don't count the cases. <strong>Count the gaps</strong>. This mental shift is the difference between a high-schooler and a competition winner.</p>
