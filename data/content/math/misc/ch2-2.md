# 2.2 Direct Variation
## The Pure Ratio of Growth

                <h2>I. Proportionality: $y = kx$</h2>
                <p>Direct variation represents the simplest linear relationship. The ratio $\frac{y}{x}$ is always a constant $k$.</p>

                    <h4>The Origin Constraint</h4>
                    <p>In the equation $y = kx$, if $x = 0$, then $y$ MUST be $0$. This means direct variation ALWAYS passes through the <strong>Origin $(0,0)$</strong>. If a line has a non-zero y-intercept, it is linear but NOT a direct variation.</p>
