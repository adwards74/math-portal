                <p>What happens to $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ as $x$ gets astronomical? It never hits zero, but it becomes indistinguishable from it. This is the <strong>Horizontal Asymptote</strong>.</p>

                <p>In Algebra 2, you learned "End Behavior". In Calculus, we formalize this as limits at infinity. They are the same thing, just with a more precise "API".</p>
