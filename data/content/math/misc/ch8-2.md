                <p>What happens if we compound every second? Every nanosecond? As $n \\to \\infty$, the compounding formula $A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$ converges to the <strong>Continuous Model</strong>:</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">The constant $e \\approx 2.718$ is the unique base such that the slope of the function $f(x) = e^x$ is exactly equal to its value at every point.</p>
