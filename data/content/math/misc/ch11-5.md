# 11.5 Convergent Series
## Summing the Infinite

                <h2>I. The Paradox of Zeno</h2>
                <p>How can you sum infinite numbers and get a finite answer? This is the core of **Calculus**. If each step gets significantly smaller ($|r| < 1$), the "tail" of the series vanishes.</p>
                
                <div class="proof-box glass">
                    \[S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}\]
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">This formula only works when the terms dwindle fast enough to be ignored at infinity. If $|r| \ge 1$, the series **Diverges** (explodes to infinity).</p>
