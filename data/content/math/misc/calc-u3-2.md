# 3.2 Implicit Differentiation
## Solving for the Hidden Velocity

                <h2>I. When y is Trapped</h2>
                <p>Implicit differentiation is used when $y$ is mixed into the equation ($x^2 + y^2 = 25$). We differentiate both sides w.r.t $x$ and treat $y$ as a function $y(x)$.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Every time you differentiate a term with $y$ in it, you MUST attach a $\frac{dy}{dx}$.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Example for a circle: $2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \implies \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}$.</p>
