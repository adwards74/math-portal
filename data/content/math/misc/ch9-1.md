                    <p>Inverse variation is about **Sharing**. If you have a fixed slice of pizza ($k$), the more people ($x$) you share it with, the smaller each slice ($y$) becomes. It is the math of finite resources and load balancing.</p>

                <h2>I. Inverse Variation: $y = k/x$</h2>
                <p>In an **Inverse Variation**, the product of two variables remains constant: $xy = k$. As one variable grows, the other must shrink to maintain the balance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Constant of Variation ($k$):</strong> This is the "Total Effort" or "Resource Cap" of the system.</p>

                <p>The time to process a 1GB file is inversely proportional to the **Bandwidth** of your network. If you double the speed ($x$), the time ($y$) is cut in half. Designing systems that scale inversely is the heart of cloud performance optimization.</p>
