                    <h3><i class="fas fa-mountain"></i> The Horizon Rule</h3>
                    <p>End behavior is like looking at a mountain range from a distance. The smaller hills (lower-degree terms) vanish, and only the highest peak (leading term) defines the shape of the horizon. In calculus, this is why we focus on 'Growth Rates'.</p>

                <h2>I. The Dominant Term Rule</h2>
                <p>The **End Behavior** of a polynomial is determined solely by its leading term $a_n x^n$. As $|x|$ becomes very large, the other terms become insignificant.</p>

                <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> CS: Big O Dominance</h4>
                <p>In complexity analysis, $O(n^3 + n^2)$ is simplified to $O(n^3)$. Why? Because as $n$ grows, the cubic term grows so much faster that the quadratic term might as well be zero. Math "End Behavior" is the foundation of Algorithm Efficiency.</p>
