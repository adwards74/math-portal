                <p>Solving rational equations is straightforward: multiply by LCD to clear fractions. But you MUST check your answers against the <strong>Excluded Values</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Solving rational equations is like monitoring a patient's pulse. Most of the time it's steady, but a zero-denominator ($NullPointer$) is a fatal heart attack. Always audit your solutions against the 'Dead Zones' of the domain.</p>

                    <p>Before any algebra, list every $x$ that makes any denominator zero. These are your **Exclusion Zones**. If your final 'solution' lands in an exclusion zone, it is a false positive.</p>
