                <h2>I. The Arithmetic Series Sum</h2>
                <p>When summing an arithmetic sequence, we use the legend of young Gauss.</p>

                    \[S_n = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}\]
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">By pairing the first and last terms, then second and second-to-last, we find that every pair sums to the same value. Summing becomes simple multiplication.</p>
