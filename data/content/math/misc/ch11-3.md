# 11.3 Geometric Scaling
## The Power of the Common Ratio ($r$)

                <h2>I. The Geometric Series Sum</h2>
                <p>For a sequence where you multiply by $r$ at each step, the sum of $n$ terms is:</p>
                
                <div class="proof-box glass">
                    \[S_n = \frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}\]
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Unlike arithmetic sums, geometric sums depend on the power of the ratio. As $n$ increases, $r^n$ either vanishes (convergence) or explodes (divergence). This formula captures the total state of that growth.</p>
