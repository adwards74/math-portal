                <p>To solve $\\log_b(x) = c$, we convert to exponential form: $b^c = x$. But we must be careful with the <strong>Domain</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Logs are asymmetrically guarded. You can grow to infinity, but you can never reach zero or become negative. It is an **Algebraic Firewall**?봳rying to log a negative number is like asking 'At what time was I before I existed?'.</p>

                    <p>Always solve the inner argument inequality ($Argument > 0$) BEFORE solving the equation. This defines your **Valid State Space**.</p>
