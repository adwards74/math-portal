# 2.3: The Power of Eigenvalues
## The Invariant Directions of Space


            <p>In most transformations, vectors change direction. But for every matrix, there are special "privileged" directions that stay the same. These are **Eigenvectors**.</p>

                <p>Eigenvectors are the vectors that only get scaled (stretched or squished) but never rotated. The factor by which they are scaled is the **Eigenvalue** ($\lambda$).</p>

                <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>: Finding the most important directions in big data.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural Engineering</strong>: Analyzing resonance and stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Google PageRank</strong>: Your search results are literally the eigenvector of the web's link matrix.</li>
