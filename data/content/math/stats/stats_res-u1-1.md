# The Null Hypothesis Protocol
## The Foundation of Scientific Skepticism


            <p>In research, we never "prove" a theory. Instead, we fail to disprove it. This is the core of the <strong>Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)</strong>.</p>

                <p>The Null Hypothesis is like the "Presumption of Innocence". We assume there is no effect (the defendant is innocent) until the evidence (data) is so overwhelming that it would be unreasonable to maintain that assumption.</p>

            <h3>1. The Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)</strong>: The status quo. No difference, no effect, no change.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)</strong>: The researcher's claim. There <em>is</em> a difference or effect.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>When studying the effect of temperature on fish respiration:</p>
                <p><strong>$H_0$:</strong> Temperature has no effect on the respiration rate of <em>Danio rerio</em>.</p>
                <p><strong>$H_a$:</strong> Increased temperature leads to a significantly higher respiration rate.</p>
